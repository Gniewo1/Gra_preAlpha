Gra_preAlpha is unfinished game that I was doing some years ago (that's prealpha in the name). Game need Python and Pygame library to work.
You run a game from Gra_preAlpha.py file. 
If the error will appear in 31 line you need to type "cd gra_prealpha" in terminal

Game controls:
arrow keys, "Z" and "X"
